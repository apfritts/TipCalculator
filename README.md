TipCalculator
=============

This is a simple Tip Calculator for iOS 8. It can calculate the tip for 10%, 15%, and 20% gratuity. In the Settings view, you are able to select your default tip amount which will be remembered across sessions.

Hours to complete: 4

Required Stories:

- Implement a tip calculator with 3 different tips: 10%, 15%, and 20%
- Create a Settings view to remember the user's default tip amount

Optional Stories:

- I don't think there were any. I did play with the Storyboard and constraints so it shows up reasonably on a variety of devices.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

This project was created using XCode 6.2 Beta targetting iOS 8.0. I tried to target 7.0 but was unsuccessful because the app ran fine in the emulator, but failed on my iPad and iPhone. I think this was because I hadn't restarted XCode after installing the necessary symbols for iOS 7.0. However, after restarting and turning on Asset Catalog, the emulator was screwed up so I re-targetted iOS 8.0. I think it had something to do with other code, and might try turning it back on, but for the sake of finishing this project, I've left it at iOS 8.0.

Acknowledgement
---------------

No libraries were used while making this project. Thank you to all the lovely folks on StackOverflow who had already answered all of my questions and to @timothy1ee for the iOS intro video.
